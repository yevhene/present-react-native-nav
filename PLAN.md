# React Native Navigation

## Native Navigation

### iOS
- Tabs

### Android
- Drawer

**Platforms is diffirent**

## Shipped solutions
- Navigator, a JS-based solution launched with React Native, but itâ€™s not powerful enough
- NavigatorIOS, only targets iOS and is not maintained anymore
- NavigationExperimental, now deprecated

**Not good enough**

## JavaScript Based solutions
One worth to mention:
- [react-router-native](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-native) - Nice and tidy, but not native

**Is good but not native. Transitions is lost.**

## Native Based solutions
### Past
- [react-native-router-flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux) - Wrapper around NavigationExperimental which is deprecated. Based on old version. Not much customizable.

### Present
- [react-native-navigation](https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation) - Implemented natively, with exposed API. So it's fast. v2.0.1937 but not ready. Not easy to install.
- [native-navigation](http://airbnb.io/native-navigation/) - AirBnb. Also Native. (Hard to install)
- [react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) - It's (almost) official. Installs easily.

**They are many**
